### Recommended Development Path 🚗

To take advantage of event driven versioning and deployments, follow the recommended development path. 

```
nth test set branch
    ↓ (merge new tests / fixtures)
    ↓ (increment minor) 
development branch ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← (New Development Cycle)
    ↓ (merge changes)                                                                                                 ↑
    ↓ (increment alpha)                                                                                               ↑
features branch ← (push new feature) ← (write implementation with AI)                                                 ↑
    ↓ (tests pass)                                                                                                    ↑
    ↓ (increment beta)                                                                                                ↑
beta branch                                                                                                           ↑
    ↓                                                                                                                 ↑
spawns stable branch, the nth beta                                                                                    ↑
    ↓ (merge changes)                                                                                                 ↑
    ↓ (increment release canidate)                                                                                    ↑
candidate branch → (spawns release canidate branch) → Auto-Deploy to TestPyPI → Deploy to PyPI → (merge changes) → main
    ↑            → → (spawns hotfix branch)
(increment patch)            ↓
    ↑                        ↓
(merge changes)              ↓
    ↑                        ↓
hotfix branch ← (merge new patch if necessary)
```

### Default Run Arguments 🏃‍♀️

In .devcontainer/.env -

- ```LICENSE_TYPE``` : MIT (See a list of valid licenses and identifiers here 👉 https://spdx.org/licenses/)
- ```UV_LINK_MODE``` : symlink ( This setting is the least noisy link mode when working in a codespace. If required, adapt this setting to your needs. )
- ```UV_PROJECT_TYPE``` : --lib ( Must be one of --app, --lib, --package. See https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/init/#libraries for more on project setup)

### Dev Container Dockerfile 🐳

```dockerfile
ARG PYTHON_VERSION=3.14
ARG IMAGE=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python${PYTHON_VERSION}-alpine

FROM $IMAGE
```
See https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/docker/ for a list of available alpine images.

### Dev Container ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES ❎

The Alpine UV image does not have git configured by default.
While git is installed automatically you still need to set your... 

- DEVELOPER : Your GitHub username.
- DEVELOPER_EMAIL : Your Github email. You may want to consider making your email private. See: https://github.com/settings/emails

in your Codespace secret store for git to work properly.

### pre-commit Hooks 🪝

By default, UvCorny calls official sync, lock, and export Astral hooks.
Offical Ruff hooks are also built in for formatting and code style standardization.

Two custom hooks are added by defualt.

- Cristopher Meissner's pytest-pre-commit (https://github.com/christophmeissner/pytest-pre-commit) is modified to allow the pytest hook to
a. Pass on the absence of tests.
b. On codespace creation, a script appends the '-r' flag and absolute path of the exported requirements.txt to the additional_dependencies pytest hook attribute. This has the net effect of recreating your projects dependencies in an isolated test enviroment upon runing the pytest hook.
  
- A custom hook which automatially updates your README.md title and description according to the title and description in the pyproject.toml. Thus you should not edit your README.md directly but rather the README.md.jinja file this hook relies on.

If you are not familar with pre-commit, any files modified by hooks will cause the hook to fail and block the commit. This ensures you double check any modifications before commitng to them. 
By combining these hooks together, you can reduce the need to add these steps to your CI/CD workflows.

You are free to modify the pre-commit configuration to your liking.
However if you choose to do so, do not remove the pytest hook. No tests are required of you, but removing this hook will cause UvCorny to break.

Furthermore, do not edit the pre-commit configuration in a codespace! This also risks breaking UvCorny.
Any modifications to the configuration should be made from the web editor.

### Creating Pytests 🧪

Tests should be writen before code. 
UvCorny automatically generates a conftest.py file which furnishes project metadata fixtures.

```python
import pytest


@pytest.fixture
def project_directory_path():
    from pathlib import Path

    return Path(__file__).parent.parent


@pytest.fixture
def project_configuration(project_directory_path):
    from tomllib import load

    with open(project_directory_path / "pyproject.toml", "rb") as f:
        configuration = load(f)
    return configuration


@pytest.fixture
def project_metadata(project_configuration):
    return project_configuration.get("project")


@pytest.fixture
def project_name(project_metadata):
    return project_metadata.get("name")

```

With these fixtures you could write a test called 'test_main.py'

```python
import pytest
from pathlib import Path


@pytest.fixture
def main_module_label(project_name):
    return f"{project_name}.{Path(__file__).parent.name}.main"


@pytest.fixture
def main_fn(main_module_label):
    return pytest.importorskip(main_module_label)


def test_main(main_fn):
    assert main_fn() is None

```

Your main function may not even exist, but that's the point!
Wrting this test tells your software agent a main function should exist and it's return value should be 'None'.
Nor do you need to implement this feature right away, you can delay it's implementation untill you have merged your tests into the feature branch.
This can be acomplished by leveraging pytest's importorskip fuction, as seen in the example above.

When implementing a new feature, create a new test set folder like so...
```markdown
\tests
   |
\new-feature-folder
   |
__init__.py
test_1_needed_to_implement_feature.py
test_2_needed_to_implement_feature.py
...
```

Copilot is prompted to create features like so...
```markdown
\src
   |
\your-cool-package
   |
__init__.py
_loader.py
\your-new-feature
  ...
```

This ensures a one to one mapping between test sets and features.

### Prompts 💬

There are two defualt prompts under ```.github/prompts/```.
These add relevant context to CoPilot specific to UvCorny.
Add or subtract as needed.
